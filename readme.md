This is an Opera extension I'm developing, mainly as a hobby but also so I can learn some new dev skills.

To install:
	

    Open up the extensions menu:

    Navigate to "opera://extensions" for Opera
    
    ~~or "chrome://extensions" for Chrome~~
    Having issues with Chrome at the moment.
    
    Enable developer mode.

    Choose "Load unpacked extension" and locate to directory where the extension is located.

Usage: 

    In the address bar, type an "r" followed by a space.  
    You can now type the name of the subreddit you would like to visit.
